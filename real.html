          This guy is Archishman, and he is damn talkative. He is good in
          science but sometimes shows of. Bullies bully himüòÇ. Anyway, he is a
          good friend. He helps me a lot and I help him a lot. I still remember
          my paper business with him. It was amazing.

          This is Kunal, and he was my first friend. He is very responsible
          person and he is a prefect, but he left 2 easy peasy questions in
          sanskrit examination. He is a very nice person if you ask from me. I
          was in class 2 when I entered this school and the first seat that was
          left was beside him but then I feeled that why people don't sit with
          him, because he takes almost all the seat(but now he is good). Ya, I
          know he is so tall, and got so much beard(i dont care). Apart from
          this he is good at studies too. Once in maths he did + instead of - or
          maybe vice-versa üòÇü§£.

          Every person is imporatant in this world. Friends are really important. They are the only relation which is not given by birth. You have to choose your own  friend. Friends are someone to talk with. Friends are someone to share feelings with. Friends are someone who can help you. Thank you! Let me end the website with a cool joke.
